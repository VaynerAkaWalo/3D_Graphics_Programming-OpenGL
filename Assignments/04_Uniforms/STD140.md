# The `std140` layout

The first rule of `std140` is

```text
If the member is a scalar consuming N basic machine units, the base alignment is N.
```

It is not explained what is a basic machine unit, but it essentially means that every scalar variable
is aligned to its size.
In practice, it means a size of float or int (4bytes) as there are no smaller scalar types.
The bool type is treated as int with regard to alignment. The only scalar type longer then four bytes is `double` which
is aligned to eight bytes. So for example if we have a uniform inteface block like this:

```glsl
layout(std140) uniform Block {
    int a;
    float b;
    float c;
    double d;
};
```

it will aligned as follows:

```text
|a|b|c|_|d|d|
```

where `|` is a 4 byte boundary and `_` denotes empty space. We will not use `double`  type in this course.

The second and third rules concern the alignment of vector types are:

```text
If the member is a two- or four-component vector with components consum-
ing N basic machine units, the base alignment is 2N or 4N , respectively.
```

```text
If the member is a three-component vector with components consuming N
basic machine units, the base alignment is 4N .
```

which means that `vec2` is aligned to eight bytes boundary and `vec3` and `vec4` are aligned to 16 bytes boundary.

So for example if we have a uniform interface block like this:

```glsl
vec2 a;
vec2 b;
vec3 c;
vec2 d;
vec4 e;
```

it will be aligned as follows:

```text
|a[0]|a[1]|b[0]|b[1]|c[0]|c[1]|c[2]|_|d[0]|d[1]|_|_|e[0]|e[1]|e[2]|e[3]|
```

Rule four is about arrays and it is essential as it also concerns matrices (rule 5). Rule four states that:

```text
If the member is an array of scalars or vectors, the base alignment and array
stride are set to match the base alignment of a single array element, according
to rules (1), (2), and (3), and rounded up to the base alignment of a vec4. The
array may have padding at the end; the base offset of the member following
the array is rounded up to the next multiple of the base alignment.
```

The rule five states that:

```text
f the member is a column-major matrix with C columns and R rows, the
matrix is stored identically to an array of C column vectors with R compo-
nents each, according to rule (4).
```

It means that in practices all elements of an array smaller or equal in size to 16 bytes, even scalars are aligned to
16 bytes boundary. Because by rule five matrices are treated like arrays  of column vectors, each column is aligned to 16 bytes even if it has less then 4 elements. So for example, if we have a uniform interface block like this:

```glsl
layout(std140) uniform Block {
mat2 R;     
};
```
and matrix `R` is stored as follows:

```text
| a b |
| c d |
```

it will be aligned as follows:

```text
|a|c|_|_|b|d|_|_|
```

and  simililarly for a 3x3 matrix
```text
| a b c |
| d e f |
| g h i |
```
which will be stored as follows:
```text
|a|b|c|_|d|e|f|_|g|h|i|_|
```
